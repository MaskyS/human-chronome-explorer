INSTRUCTION: This document contains samples of CSV data structures. Each file section starts with "FILE:" followed by the filename. After each filename, you'll find HEADERS: showing column names separated by | characters, then SAMPLE_ROWS: showing actual data rows with values separated by | characters. Each file section ends with META: containing the total number of rows and columns in the original CSV file, followed by ---. Use this structure to understand the data format of each CSV file and the relationships between columns and values. When asked about specific files, look for the relevant FILE: marker and analyze the headers and sample rows that follow it. All numeric values and data types are preserved exactly as they appear in the original files.
